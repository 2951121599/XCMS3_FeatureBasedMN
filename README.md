## Introduction

The Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on [GNPS](http://gnps.ucsd.edu). The tools supported are: MZmine2, OpenMS, MS-DIAL, MetaboScape, and XCMS.

The main documentation for Feature-Based Molecular Networking with XCMS [can be accessed here:](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-xcms3/)

This repository contains example script in python and R showing how `xcms` version >= 3 (XCMS3) can used for the
FBMN workflow in GNPS using a subset of the American Gut Project.

### Installation of XCMS-GNPS workflow for FBMN

Install the latest version of XCMS3 (version >= 3.4) from Bioconductor in R
with:

```
install("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("xcms")
```
See also [xcms Bioconductor package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html).

See or clone the Github repository for utility functions specific to this workflow.
